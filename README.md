# Ad Campaign Analysis with SQL and Looker Studio

## Introduction
This repository contains SQL scripts and Google Looker Studio dashboards designed to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns on both Google Ads and Facebook Ads. The goal of this project is to provide insights into campaign effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and inform future marketing decisions.

## Data Sources
The data for this project was extracted from a PostgreSQL database containing four primary tables:
* **Facebook Ads:** `facebook_ads_basic_daily`, `facebook_adset`, `facebook_campaign`
* **Google Ads:** `google_ads_basic_daily`

## Tools
DBeaver, Looker Studio

## SQL Queries

### Query 1. Facebook Campaign Metrics Daily

~~~SQL
SELECT
	f.ad_date,
	f.campaign_id,
	sum (f.spend) AS spend,
	sum (f.impressions) AS impressions,
	sum (f.clicks) AS clicks,
	sum (f.value) AS value,
	sum (f.spend) / sum (f.clicks) AS cpc,
	round((sum(f.spend) ::NUMERIC / sum(f.impressions)) * 1000,
	2) AS cpm,
	round((sum(f.clicks) ::NUMERIC / sum(f.impressions)) * 100,
	2) AS ctr,
	round((((sum(f.value) - sum(f.spend)) ::NUMERIC / sum(f.spend))) * 100,
	2) AS romi
FROM
	facebook_ads_basic_daily f
WHERE 
	f.campaign_id IS NOT NULL
	AND f.clicks > 0
	AND f.impressions > 0
	AND f.spend > 0
	AND f.impressions > 0
GROUP BY 
	f.ad_date,
	f.campaign_id
ORDER BY
	f.ad_date DESC;
 ~~~

This SQL query analyzes Facebook ad performance data from the `facebook_ads_basic_daily` table. It calculates key metrics for each day and campaign:

1. **Total Spend:** The total amount spent on ads.
2. **Total Impressions:** The total number of times ads were shown.
3. **Total Clicks:** The total number of clicks on ads.
4. **Total Value:** The total value generated by the ads.
5. **CPC (Cost Per Click):** The average cost per click.
6. **CPM (Cost Per Mille):** The cost per 1000 impressions.
7. **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** The percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks.
8. **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment):** The return on investment for the ads, expressed as a percentage.

The query filters out records with zero clicks, impressions, or spend to avoid division by zero errors. It then groups the results by date and campaign ID and sorts them by date in descending order.

### Query 2. Daily Ad Performance by Platform 

~~~SQL
WITH combined_ads AS (
SELECT
        ad_date,
	'Facebook Ads' AS media_source,
	spend,
	impressions,
	reach,
	clicks,
	leads,
	value
FROM
	facebook_ads_basic_daily f
WHERE
        ad_date IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT
	ad_date,
	'Google Ads' AS media_source,
	spend,
	impressions,
	reach,
	clicks,
	leads,
	value
FROM
	google_ads_basic_daily g
WHERE
	ad_date IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
	ad_date,
	media_source,
	sum (spend) / sum (clicks) AS CPC,
	round((sum(spend)::NUMERIC / sum(impressions)) * 1000,
	2) AS CPM,
	round((sum(clicks)::NUMERIC / sum(impressions)) * 100,
	2) AS CTR,
	round((((sum(value) - sum(spend))::NUMERIC / sum(spend))) * 100,
	2) AS ROMI
FROM
	combined_ads
WHERE
	reach > 0
	AND leads > 0
	AND clicks > 0
	AND impressions > 0
	AND spend > 0
	AND impressions > 0
GROUP BY
	ad_date,
	media_source
ORDER BY
	ad_date,
	media_source DESC;
~~~

This SQL query combines data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads into a single dataset, calculates key performance metrics, and filters out irrelevant data.

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Data Combination:**
   - It merges data from `facebook_ads_basic_daily` and `google_ads_basic_daily` tables into a single Common Table Expression (CTE) named `combined_ads`.
   - It adds a `media_source` column to differentiate between the two platforms.

2. **Metric Calculation:**
   - It calculates the following metrics for each date and media source:
     - **CPC (Cost Per Click):** Average cost per click.
     - **CPM (Cost Per Mille):** Cost per 1000 impressions.
     - **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks.
     - **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment):** Percentage return on investment.

3. **Data Filtering:**
   - It filters the data to exclude records with zero values for `reach`, `leads`, `clicks`, `impressions`, and `spend` to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Grouping and Sorting:**
   - It groups the results by `ad_date` and `media_source`.
   - It sorts the results by `ad_date` in descending order and then by `media_source` in descending order.
  
### Query 3. Combined Ad Set Daily Performance

~~~

This SQL query combines data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads into a single dataset, providing a detailed view of campaign and ad set performance.

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Data Combination:**
   - It merges data from `facebook_ads_basic_daily`, `facebook_adset`, and `facebook_campaign` tables for Facebook Ads.
   - It merges data from the `google_ads_basic_daily` table for Google Ads.
   - The resulting dataset includes information about ad date, media source, campaign name, ad set name, spend, impressions, reach, clicks, leads, and value.

2. **Data Aggregation:**
   - It groups the combined data by `ad_date`, `media_source`, `campaign_name`, and `adset_name`.
   - It calculates the total spend, impressions, clicks, and value for each group.

3. **Result Ordering:**
   - It sorts the results by `ad_date` in descending order.

**In essence, this query provides a consolidated view of advertising performance across both platforms, allowing for detailed analysis and comparison of campaigns and ad sets.**

## Ad Campaign Analysis: Key Findings and Optimization Recommendations

### Key Findings:

* **Growth in spending and ROMI in early 2021:** There was a significant increase in both overall advertising spending and ROMI in early 2021, indicating high campaign effectiveness during this period.
* **Stabilization and decline:** Following the peak in early 2021, there was a trend towards stabilization and even a decline in both spending and ROMI. This could be attributed to various factors such as seasonality, changing market conditions, or campaign optimizations.
* **Sharp decline in late 2022:** A sharp decrease in both spending and ROMI was observed in late 2022, possibly indicating significant changes in advertising strategy or external factors impacting campaign effectiveness.
* **CPC variation:** Cost per click (CPC) varied significantly, with lower values for "Discounts" and "Crazy discounts" campaigns and higher values for "Expansion" and "Brand" campaigns. This could be due to differing levels of competition in respective niches or targeting specifics.
* **CPM variation:** Cost per thousand impressions (CPM) also showed significant differences. Higher CPM values were typical for campaigns with a wide audience or premium placements.
* **CTR variation:** Click-through rate (CTR) varied depending on the campaign type and creatives. "Discounts" and "New items" campaigns had the highest CTRs, suggesting their attractiveness to users.
* **ROMI variation:** Return on marketing investment (ROMI) also varied significantly across different campaign types. "Promos" and "Trendy" campaigns demonstrated the highest ROMI values, indicating their high effectiveness.

### Recommendations for Optimization:
* **Analyze the sharp decline in late 2022:** Conduct a detailed analysis to identify the causes of this significant drop.
* **Compare across channels:** Compare the effectiveness of advertising campaigns across different channels (e.g., social media, search engines) to identify the most effective ones.
* **Test new strategies:** Continuously test new advertising strategies, audiences, and creatives to find optimal solutions.
* **Monitor competitors:** Keep an eye on competitors' actions and adjust your advertising strategy accordingly.
* **Utilize analytics tools:** Use analytics tools to collect and analyze data on campaign effectiveness.
* **Optimize spending:** Conduct a deeper analysis of low-ROMI campaigns to identify the reasons for low efficiency and take measures to optimize them (e.g., adjust bids, change creatives, refine target audience).
* **Focus on effective channels:** Pay more attention to high-ROMI campaigns like "Promos" and "Trendy," considering increasing their budgets.
* **Test new formats:** To improve campaign effectiveness, test new advertising formats, creatives, and target audiences.
* **Analyze seasonality:** Consider seasonal demand fluctuations and adjust advertising budgets accordingly.
* **Use analytics tools:** Use analytics tools to monitor campaign performance and identify trends for informed decision-making.

**In essence, the analysis suggests that while the company has a diverse range of advertising campaigns, there's room for optimization. By focusing on high-performing campaigns, testing new strategies, and continuously monitoring performance, the company can improve the overall effectiveness of its advertising efforts.**
