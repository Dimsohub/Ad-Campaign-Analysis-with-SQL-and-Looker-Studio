# Ad Campaign Analysis with SQL and Looker Studio

## Introduction
This repository contains SQL scripts and Google Looker Studio dashboards designed to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns on both Google Ads and Facebook Ads. The goal of this project is to provide insights into campaign effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and inform future marketing decisions.

## Data Sources
The data for this project was extracted from a PostgreSQL database containing four primary tables:
* **Facebook Ads:** `facebook_ads_basic_daily`, `facebook_adset`, `facebook_campaign`
* **Google Ads:** `google_ads_basic_daily`

### Calculating key metrics for each day and campaign

	f.campaign_id,

	sum (f.clicks) AS clicks,

WHERE 
	f.campaign_id IS NOT NULL
	AND f.clicks > 0
	AND f.impressions > 0

	AND f.impressions > 0

This SQL query analyzes Facebook ad performance data from the `facebook_ads_basic_daily` table. It calculates key metrics for each day and campaign:

1. **Total Spend:** The total amount spent on ads.
2. **Total Impressions:** The total number of times ads were shown.
3. **Total Clicks:** The total number of clicks on ads.
4. **Total Value:** The total value generated by the ads.
5. **CPC (Cost Per Click):** The average cost per click.
6. **CPM (Cost Per Mille):** The cost per 1000 impressions.
7. **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** The percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks.
8. **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment):** The return on investment for the ads, expressed as a percentage.

The query filters out records with zero clicks, impressions, or spend to avoid division by zero errors. It then groups the results by date and campaign ID and sorts them by date in descending order.
